## Environment Variables

### About the folder structure

The folder structure is a very typical one, where there is a container folder that stores the "apps", including an app, called shared, as its name indicates, I store things in common, or shared. The main app is core.

The project has 5 subapplications authentication, exam, shared, student and user. This separating the logic.
